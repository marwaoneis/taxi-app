### MedConnect is built using a combination of modern technologies. Below is an overview of the key technologies employed in the development of MedConnect.

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) is chosen for its component-based architecture, enabling the development of a dynamic and responsive user interface for SpeedyTrip. It facilitates the creation of an intuitive experience for passengers and drivers on the web platform.
- **Framework**: [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is utilized for its elegant syntax and robust features, which serve as the backbone for the backend of SpeedyTrip. Laravel offers comprehensive tools for authentication, routing, sessions, and caching, making it ideal for building a scalable and secure server-side application.
- **Framework**: [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) is integrated to develop the administrative interface of SpeedyTrip, allowing for the creation of a desktop application that runs on multiple operating systems. Electron combines the power of Chromium and Node.js, making it possible to build desktop apps with web technologies.
- **Technology**: [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io/) is implemented for authentication in Laravel, providing a secure and efficient way to manage user sessions and API requests. JWT enhances the security of SpeedyTrip by enabling stateless authentication.
- **Database**: [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent) is Laravel's native ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) used for database interactions within SpeedyTrip. It simplifies data manipulation and retrieval by allowing expressive and fluent database queries, along with seamless relationships management.
- **Language**: [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) is the primary programming language for SpeedyTrip, powering both the React frontend and the Node.js within Electron's backend. JavaScript's versatility and widespread support make it an ideal choice for this full-stack development project.
